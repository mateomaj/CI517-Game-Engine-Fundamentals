# CI517-Game-Engine-Fundamentals
Source code for a Scene Graph system designed for CI517 - Game Engine Fundamentals

The main files for the handin are:
 - "MyEngineSystem.h"
 - "MyEngineSystem.cpp"
 - "MyGame.h"
 - "MyGame.cpp"

The remaining header/c++ files include edits that were made to the base XCUBE game engine so the other systems could fit better with the goals for the scene graph system.
Each file was cleaned up to only include the necessary comments.
